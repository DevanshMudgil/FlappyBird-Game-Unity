This is the first game that i have created in unity.
It is a 2D game that i have build by taking help from yt.
It is FlappyBird Game in this we just have to save the bird form the pipes and move formward in the game as much pipes we cross our score increases but if we colide with any of the pispe the game ends and we have to start again.
